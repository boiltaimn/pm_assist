**Exception**: Designing business processes primarily for typical orders while isolating exceptional orders. This prevents exceptions from disrupting normal operations and potentially allows for specialized expertise development in handling exceptions.

**Flexible assignment**: Flexible assignment is a strategy where resources are assigned tasks in a manner that maximizes flexibility for the near future. For instance, if a task can be done by either of two available resources, it is assigned to the most specialized resource. This preserves the availability of the more general resource for other tasks.

**Outsourcing**: Outsourcing involves delegating a business process or parts of it to a third party who might perform it more efficiently. This can include tasks like customer service, manufacturing, or data processing.

**Parallelism**: Parallelism refers to the practice of executing tasks in parallel, as opposed to sequentially, in a business process. This strategy can substantially reduce the throughput time of a process.

**Knock-out**: Knock-out involves ordering tasks in a decreasing order of effort and an increasing order of termination probability. It focuses on tasks that check various conditions needed for a positive result in the business process. Any unmet condition can lead to termination, or "knock-out" of that part of the process. In example “Early termination”: immediately stopping the process at its initial stages if key conditions are not met, in order to save resources.

**Customer Teams**: The practice of customer teams involves assigning teams consisting of workers from different departments to handle specific types of orders. This is a variation of the order assignment practice and can result in more workers with similar qualifications working on the same tasks, easing the Inflexibility of the order assignment practice.

**Trusted party**: Using a trusted party involves relying on information or assessments provided by a reputable third party, rather than independently verifying or generating the information. For example, accepting a creditworthiness certificate from another bank instead of assessing a customer's creditworthiness internally.

**Resequencing**: This is the process of rearranging tasks to optimize the order in which they're performed. This could involve postponing certain tasks or placing similar tasks closer together to reduce setup times.

**Integration**: This heuristic aimed at closely connecting a company's business processes with those of its customers or suppliers. In this strategy, all parties involved in production collaboratively manufacture a product while conducting frequent reviews and discussions to ensure product quality and improve production efficiency. Through this approach, all parties can better integrate and utilize their resources, achieving both efficiency and quality enhancement.

**Buffering**: Buffering in business processes means subscribing to updates from external sources, instead of actively requesting information each time. This ensures that information is readily available when needed, similar to caching in microprocessors.

**Task composition or decomposition**: Task composition involves combining small tasks into larger, composite tasks, and decomposition dividing large tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks. This strategy seeks to reduce setup times and improve the quality of work, while also maintaining task manageability and flexibility.

**Control relocation**: Control relocation refers to the practice of shifting checks and reconciliation operations from the business to the customer side in a business process. For example, supermarket self-service payment.

**Order-based work**: This practice suggests removing batch-processing and periodic activities from a business process. Thereby significantly speeding up the processing of individual orders.

**Split Responsibilities and Numerical Involvement**: This strategy encourages reducing the number of departments and individuals involved to lessen coordination issues and potential conflicts. It includes avoiding task assignments to people from different functional units and minimizing the number of people involved in any specific task. This leads to improved task execution quality and responsiveness while reducing throughput time and queue.

**Case Manager**: This heuristic involves appointing one person as responsible for the handling of each type of order. This person, the case manager, is responsible for a specific order or customer but does not necessarily perform the tasks related to it. The focus is on the management of the process rather than its execution.

**Empower**: Empowerment in business processes means granting workers the authority to make decisions, reducing the reliance on middle management for authorizations.

**Order assignment**: This practice involves letting workers perform as many steps as possible for a single order. This reduces the setup time as the workers will be acquainted with the case, possibly improving service quality. However, this can significantly decrease the flexibility of resource allocation.

**Order types**: The concept of "Order Types" involves identifying whether tasks are associated with the same type of order and, if necessary, creating new separate business processes. This practice highlights the importance of not ignoring subflows that are not specific to the business process they are part of.

**Contact reduction**: By reducing the number of contacts, you can save time and increase efficiency. Because exchanging information with customers or third parties is often time-consuming.

**Triage**: This involves redefining tasks to align with resource capabilities and order characteristics. It can be through splitting a general task into alternative ones, or merging alternative tasks into a general one. Another form of triage is dividing a task into similar tasks for different order subcategories.

**Workload Management**: "Workload Management" is the process of effectively distributing tasks among team members or across an organization to optimize productivity and prevent burnout. It involves monitoring workloads, prioritizing tasks, and assessing team capacity.

**Process Standardization**: Process standardization refers to the creation and implementation of consistent, standardized processes and rules to ensure efficiency and consistency in business operations. This typically includes defining clear steps, tasks, responsibilities and standards to guide workflow within the organization.

**Cross-functional Collaboration**: Cross-functional collaboration is when employees from different functions or departments work together towards a common goal or project.
