In a healthcare recovery ward process, the surgery ward makes calls to check if the care unit has a room available and a patient can be transported to them. On average, it is necessary to call at least four times from the surgery ward to the care unit until there is a free place and the time of the patient's transportation can be planned. Calling back and forth several times are non-value-added activities.

<Output Redesign>:

4 Implement a scheduling system to plan patients' transportation in advance, based on predicted room availability.
5 Use predictive models for patient discharge, to better forecast when a bed will be available.

Risk rate of a process is calculated as probability * consequences. The probabilities are defined as a score assigned by the team of experts from very rare to frequent, they also define the consequences in terms of health and safety, economic impact, environmental impact and company reputation. For instance, a process has a minor risk if the process failure has the following consequences: discomfort, medication and/ or accidents can be resolved in 1–3 days; economic impact is <10,000 EUR; has minimal environmental impact and bares reputation losses within company boundaries. Conversely, a process with a catastrophic risk rate has the following consequences: lethal exposure or fatal accident in terms of health and safety; financial losses of >10 million EUR; causing permanent environmental damage and baring reputation losses at a national level.

In a manufacturing company, a process of creating sales forecasting resulted in non-accurate forecasts which impacted the production schedules and caused mismatch of production schedules with inventories to demand.

<Output Redesign>: 

1. Advanced Forecasting Tools: Utilize more sophisticated forecasting tools that use AI and machine learning to better predict sales based on historical data, trends, and market conditions.

2. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Enhance collaboration between sales, production, and supply chain teams to create a more holistic and accurate forecast. 

3. Real-time Data: Leverage real-time sales data to make adjustments to the forecast and production schedules as necessary. 

4. Market Research: Regularly conduct market research to understand demand trends and incorporate this information into the forecasting process.

5. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI): Consider implementing a VMI system where suppliers manage inventory levels based on real-time sales data.

6. Training: Provide additional training to personnel responsible for sales forecasting to improve their skills and knowledge.

7. Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP): Implement a robust S&OP process to align supply and demand while considering the financial implications.

8. Scenario Analysis: Regularly conduct scenario analyses to prepare for various demand situations and to be able to respond quickly to changes in the market.

9. Customer Input: Include input from key customers in the sales forecasting process, especially for large, predictable orders.

10. Regular Review: Regularly review and adjust the forecasting process and methodologies to continually improve accuracy.
