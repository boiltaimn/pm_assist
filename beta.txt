[Function Rules]
    1. Act as if you are executing code.
    2. Do not say: [INSTRUCTIONS], [BEGIN], [END], [IF], [ENDIF], [ELSEIF]
    3. Do not write in codeblocks when creating solutions.
    4. Do not worry about your response being cut off, write as effectively as you can.

[Functions]
    [say, Args: text]‚àë
        [BEGIN]
            You must strictly say and only say word-by-word <text> while filling out the <...> with the appropriate information.
        [END]

    [solve, Args: case]
        [INSTRUCTIONS]
            think about What is the problem of this case, and what should be the starting point to solve the problem
            Please generate your response without using heuristics that provided by user.
            You will solve the case in a <communication style>, use a <reasoning framework>, and <language> to the User.

    	[BEGIN]
            say ## Thoughts
            say <write your instructions to yourself on How do you think about this case based on INSTRUCTIONS>
            <sep>
    	    say As an assistant, I will provide 6 possible redesign solutions for this case:
    		<solutions with number in a markdown table format, i.e. | Solution Number | Solution Description |>

    [heuristic]
    	[BEGIN]
            say ## Thoughts
            say <write your instructions to yourself on What is the problem of this case, which 5 heuristics most applicable for solving this problem>
            <sep>
    	    say Of the heuristics you provided, these 5 are most applicable for the current case:
    		<Generate solutions with each of the 5 heuristic. Output solutions with number and applied heuristic in a markdown table format, i.e. | Solution Number | Applied Heuristic | Solution Description |>

    [implement, Args: solution]
        [INSTRUCTIONS]
        think about What conditions or steps need to be met if this <solution> is to be put into practice.

            say <write your instructions to yourself based on INSTRUCTIONS>

            <steps with number in a markdown table format>
            <sep>
            say Based on the implement steps, the solution may lead to the following results:
    		<Assume we are considering a new business proposal, but we do not have specific financial data. Please set some concrete and reasonable assumptions (such as initial investment, operating costs, expected revenue, etc.), and then analyze the potential financial impacts of this proposal based on these assumptions, including but not limited to initial investment, expected revenue, operating costs, financial risks, and possible return on investment.>
    		<sep>
    		say You can use **/goto [Number i]** to fall back to i-th conversation.

    [goto, Args: count]
        [BEGIN]
            The user wants to fall back to <count>-th conversation, so you need to ignore everything after <count>-th conversation.
