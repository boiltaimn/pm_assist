**Exception**

Definition:
Designing business processes primarily for typical orders while isolating exceptional orders. This prevents exceptions from disrupting normal operations and potentially allows for specialized expertise development in handling exceptions.

Pros:
- Better Efficiency of normal orders
- Better Overall performance  (possible, if specialized expertise is developed)

Cons:
- Less Flexibility
- Higher Cost due to the need for specialized expertise in handling exceptions


**Flexible assignment**

Definition:
Flexible assignment is a strategy where resources are assigned tasks in a manner that maximizes flexibility for the near future. For instance, if a task can be done by either of two available resources, it is assigned to the most specialized resource. This preserves the availability of the more general resource for other tasks.

Pros:
- queue time reduce
- better quality

Cons:
- potential work load imbalance
- less job satisfaction
- less career growth opportunities for specialists


**Outsourcing**

Definition:
Outsourcing involves delegating a business process or parts of it to a third party who might perform it more efficiently. This can include tasks like customer service, manufacturing, or data processing.

Pros:
- less cost
- better quality

Cons:
- more coordination efforts
- may make business process more complex


**Parallelism**

Definition:
Parallelism refers to the practice of executing tasks in parallel, as opposed to sequentially, in a business process. This strategy can substantially reduce the throughput time of a process.

Pros:
- less throughput time

Cons:
- more cost
- more complex of managing concurrent tasks
- Potential quality decline
- less flexibility


**Knock-out**

Definition:
Knock-out involves ordering tasks in a decreasing order of effort and an increasing order of termination probability. It focuses on tasks that check various conditions needed for a positive result in the business process. Any unmet condition can lead to termination, or "knock-out" of that part of the process. In example “Early termination”: immediately stopping the process at its initial stages if key conditions are not met, in order to save resources.

Pros:
- reduce business process execution cost

Cons:
- less freedom of task ordering
- less throughput time


**Customer Teams**

Definition:
The practice of customer teams involves assigning teams consisting of workers from different departments to handle specific types of orders. This is a variation of the order assignment practice and can result in more workers with similar qualifications working on the same tasks, easing the Inflexibility of the order assignment practice.

Pros:
- Similar to the order assignment best practices:
- better Quality (improved work attractiveness and understanding)
- less Setup time
- better service quality

Cons:
- less flexibility of resource allocation
- more Queue time + (if the assigned person is not available)


**Trusted party**

Definition:
Using a trusted party involves relying on information or assessments provided by a reputable third party, rather than independently verifying or generating the information. For example, accepting a creditworthiness certificate from another bank instead of assessing a customer's creditworthiness internally.

Pros:
- less cost
- less throughput time

Cons:
- more dependency on another party's quality
- more coordination effort with trusted parties
- less flexibility


**Resequencing**

Definition:
This is the process of rearranging tasks to optimize the order in which they're performed. This could involve postponing certain tasks or placing similar tasks closer together to reduce setup times.

Pros:
- less cost
- less Setup time


**Integration**

Definition:
This heuristic aimed at closely connecting a company's business processes with those of its customers or suppliers. In this strategy, all parties involved in production collaboratively manufacture a product while conducting frequent reviews and discussions to ensure product quality and improve production efficiency. Through this approach, all parties can better integrate and utilize their resources, achieving both efficiency and quality enhancement.
Pros:
- more execution efficiency (time and cost)

Cons:
- increased mutual dependence
- less flexibility


**Buffering**

Definition:
Buffering in business processes means subscribing to updates from external sources, instead of actively requesting information each time. This ensures that information is readily available when needed, similar to caching in microprocessors.

Pros:
- less throughput times

Cons:
- additional subscription fees
- more cost of storing information


**Task composition or decomposition**

Definition:
Task composition involves combining small tasks into larger, composite tasks, and decomposition dividing large tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks. This strategy seeks to reduce setup times and improve the quality of work, while also maintaining task manageability and flexibility.

Pros:
- Reduced setup times
- Improved quality of work

Cons:
- Reduced runtime flexibility
- Reduced task manageability


**Control relocation**

Definition:
Control relocation refers to the practice of shifting checks and reconciliation operations from the business to the customer side in a business process. For example, supermarket self-service payment.

Pros:
- Reduced billing errors
- Increased customer satisfaction

Cons:
- Increased yield


**Order-based work**

Definition:
This practice suggests removing batch-processing and periodic activities from a business process. Thereby significantly speeding up the processing of individual orders.

Pros:
- speed up individual order handling

Cons:
- less scale efficiencies
- more cost of maintaining information system


**Split Responsibilities and Numerical Involvement**

Definition: This strategy encourages reducing the number of departments and individuals involved to lessen coordination issues and potential conflicts. It includes avoiding task assignments to people from different functional units and minimizing the number of people involved in any specific task. This leads to improved task execution quality and responsiveness while reducing throughput time and queue.

Pros:
- Better task execution quality
- Faster responsiveness
- Less throughput time

Cons:
- Potential for increased queuing


**Case Manager**

Definition:
This heuristic involves appointing one person as responsible for the handling of each type of order. This person, the case manager, is responsible for a specific order or customer but does not necessarily perform the tasks related to it. The focus is on the management of the process rather than its execution.

Pros:
- Improved external business process quality
- Increased customer satisfaction
- Potential improvement in internal quality due to accountability

Cons:
- increased costs


**Empower**

Definition:
Empowerment in business processes means granting workers the authority to make decisions, reducing the reliance on middle management for authorizations.

Pros:
- Reduced throughput times
- Reduced labor cost

Cons:
- Potential decrease in quality of decisions
- Increased cost of handling orders (in case of errors or bad decisions)


**Order assignment**

Definition:
This practice involves letting workers perform as many steps as possible for a single order. This reduces the setup time as the workers will be acquainted with the case, possibly improving service quality. However, this can significantly decrease the flexibility of resource allocation.

Pros:
- less Setup time
- better service quality

Cons:
- less flexibility of resource allocation
- more Queue time + (if the assigned person is not available)


**Order types**

Definition:
The concept of "Order Types" involves identifying whether tasks are associated with the same type of order and, if necessary, creating new separate business processes. This practice highlights the importance of not ignoring subflows that are not specific to the business process they are part of.

Pros:
- less processing times
- more cost
- better efficiency

Cons:
- more coordination problems
- less flexibility


**Contact reduction**

Definition:
By reducing the number of contacts, you can save time and increase efficiency. Because exchanging information with customers or third parties is often time-consuming.

Pros:
- less throughput time
- better quality


**Triage**

Definition:
This involves redefining tasks to align with resource capabilities and order characteristics. It can be through splitting a general task into alternative ones, or merging alternative tasks into a general one. Another form of triage is dividing a task into similar tasks for different order subcategories.

Pros:
- better Quality
- better Resource utilization
- less Cost
- less Time

Cons:
- less Flexibility
- more Work monotony
