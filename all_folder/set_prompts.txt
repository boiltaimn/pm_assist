1. /solve

You are a process mining expert, your task is to provide some possible redesign ideas based on CASE, please follow the EXAMPLE below, and give some redesign ideas for the CASE I gave.

[EXAMPLE.CASE]
In a university registrar’s office processes, employee manually enters students’ data into the system. Which lead to long processing times.
[EXAMPLE.SOLUTION]
The main problem appears to be the manual entry. This process is likely causing significant delays due to the laborious nature of manual data entry. The solution should focus on improving the efficiency of the data entry process. I will provide 6 possible redesign solutions for this case:
1. Implement an automated data entry system that can quickly process and upload large quantities of student data.
2. Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies to digitize physical student documents.
3. Train employees in the use of data entry software, thus reducing errors and increasing speed.
4. Establish a student self-service portal where students can enter their own data, reducing the workload on office staff.
5. Outsource the data entry process to a company that specializes in this field.

CASE



2. /heuristic

Now you need to read some heuristics and determine which 5 of them are most applicable for the case.
---
LIST OF HEURISTIC
- Exception: Prioritizes typical orders and isolates exceptions to maintain normal operations.
- Flexible assignment: Maximizes future flexibility by intelligent task assignment among resources.
- Outsourcing: Enhances efficiency by delegating certain processes to third parties.
- Parallelism: Reduces process time by performing tasks in parallel.
- Knock-out: Orders tasks by effort and termination likelihood, allows early process termination if conditions aren't met.
- Customer Teams: Creates diverse teams to handle specific orders, improving operational flexibility.
- Trusted party: Leverages third-party assessments or information, saving verification efforts.
- Resequencing: Optimizes task execution by intelligent reordering, reducing setup times.
- Integration: Enhances production efficiency through collaboration with customers or suppliers.
- Buffering: Subscribes to external updates for immediate information availability.
- Task composition or decomposition: Enhances work quality and reduces setup times by smart task composition or decomposition.
- Control relocation: Moves checks and reconciliation to the customer side to simplify business operations.
- Order-based work: Speeds up order processing by eliminating batch-processing and periodic activities.
- Split Responsibilities and Numerical Involvement: Simplifies coordination and minimizes conflicts by reducing involved parties.
- Case Manager: Dedicates one person for each order type focusing on process management.
- Empower: Accelerates decision-making by granting more authority to workers.
- Order assignment: Improves service quality by letting workers handle as many steps as possible for an order.
- Order types: Differentiates tasks based on order type to potentially establish new processes.
- Contact reduction: Enhances efficiency by limiting the number of contacts.
- Triage: Aligns tasks with resource capabilities and order requirements.
- Workload Management: Optimizes productivity and avoids burnout by effective task distribution.
- Process Standardization: Ensures operational efficiency and consistency through standardized processes.
- Cross-functional Collaboration: Promotes teamwork across different departments towards a shared goal.
